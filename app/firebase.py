Initialises the Firebase Admin SDK once.
Called at application startup before any request is handled.

On Railway: set FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON to the contents of your
            Firebase service account JSON file (single-line string).
            Download it from: Firebase Console → Project Settings → Service Accounts.

Locally:    Either set FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON,
            or set GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS to the file path.
